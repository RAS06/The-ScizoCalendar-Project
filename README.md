# The-ScizoCalendar-Project

The following project is insipred by the Simulcruella genre of storytelling, where lore sections are hidden throughout a seemingly normal program (a
calendar in this instance). 

If one amongst you would desire to explore the mechanics of this machine without expending a great deal of time using this machine (particularly
you, Mr. Pfeffer), there is a randomization function within TheMiseryMachine.java that determines the chance that a random event will occur.
Change the maximum range of that random number statement to approximately three or so and abnormalities will rapid-fire. 

Issues pertaining to the crisis observed in regards to the Java language's operation on images taken on a Samsumg phone can be viewed in a hyperlink
within the following document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qh1zTqYTjI_nZ1ltPn7l-lOw-uZwHuXQ-bECUWFEyfI/edit?usp=sharing.

Thank you for viewing the SchizoCalendar.
